# Zowe Parsing Engine for SMF or RMF PP Reports
## *Short Project Description*
Zowe is a great systems operations tool. One of the systems programmers
or performance analyzer's job is to decode SMF/RMF reports to check system's
health. Having a generic parser for SMF datasets and/or RMF (or CMF) reports
for Zowe would open various opportunities to create/re-use many open-source
monitoring tools out there.
